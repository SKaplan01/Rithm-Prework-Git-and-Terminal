Part II

1. man brings up the manual for Terminal. To scroll, use arrow keys (or scroll with two fingers on trackpad). To get out of man, type "q"
2. For ls, the -a flag includes files that begin with '.' in the list. The -l flag lists files in long format, which displays additional information including the owner, group name, and number of bytes in each file.
3. curl https://www.google.com > google.html
4. less google.html 
5. less google.html
   /hplogo (pattern wasn't found, but I tried searching for other text I could see in the file and it was found)
6. Option -> to jump forward, Option <-- to jump back
7. Ctrl + e
8. Ctrl + a
9. Ctrl + w (cuts the word directly behind the cursor)
10. The terminal is a program that lets the user interact with a shell. The shell is the program that actually runs the commands that are typed into the terminal.
11. An absolute path always starts from the root directory and describes the full path. 
12. A relative path is a path from the present direction.
13. A flag adds additional information to a command (examples: -r -rf for the rm command and -a for the ls command)
14. When a directory is not empty, the -r flag when used with rm command goes through each folder and file to remove it and the -f flag forces removal
